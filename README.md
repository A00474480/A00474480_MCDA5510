Hi, my name is Sivleen Kaur. I am from Punjab, India. I have completed my BTech in Communication and Computer Engineering from LNMIIT, Jaipur, India. After completing my undergraduate, I worked at Traction on Demand as a mulesoft developer for around ten months. Later, the company was acquired by Salesforce, and since then, I have worked as a Mulesoft Developer at Salesforce, with an overall experience of 2 years as a Mulesfot Developer. I also have experience working as a salesforce developer, specifically in the salesforce industries(velocity). My A#(SMU Id) is A00474480, and my prefered email is sivleen.kaur@smu.ca

Including me(Sivleen), our team has three members:

Wenqing(Vincent) Zhuang: He is from China. He is fond of coding, computer games and TV shows. He chose MCDA because he wanted to learn something about data science and work in Canada in future.

Di(Julius) Sun: He is also from China. Coding is one of his core interests; he also loves TV shows, specifically Sitcoms.

We bounded over our interest in watching TV shows(Sitcoms mainly). We sat together in the first class, and while talking, we realised that we all loved to watch comedies such as "The Big Bang Theories" and "Friends". We mainly talked about Friends. On the technical side, we all are fond of coding, and while conversing, I learned that Wenqing(Vincent) and I use the same programming language that is C++.
